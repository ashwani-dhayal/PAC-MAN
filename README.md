# PAC-MAN
This is my first C project I've worked on.
The difficulty of Pac-Man increases by the difference between Pac-Man’s speed and the ghosts’ speed. In addition to previous differences, it reduces the time of the ghosts’ departure delay and their frightened state. In the project version, the ghost will take better or worse movement decisions according to the level of Pac-Man, no other attribute will be changed in the execution time.
In Pac-man game, while attempting to find your way through a labyrinth, the objective of this game is to consume as many of the small dots as you can. The up, down, left, and right arrow keys on the keyboard are used to control Pac-Man’s movement around the game screen on to use and navigate.
The Pac-Man game written in the C programming language features a design that is uncluttered and simple, making it simple for users to learn. 
The striking idea behind this project is to evaluate the experience of the users in front of a game difficulty fitted to their playing level.
